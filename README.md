### About the repo

This is a repository created to store projects templates in different
languages. The goal is to automate and to standardize the way I structure my
projects, making it easy to start to implement new ideas.

Each supported language has four basic pillars: a well defined directory
structure, a build system and a unit testing framework (when applicable),

### Built with

Each language has a different structure, therefore different tools are needed.
The build systems are written using [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/), and the used unit testing frameworks are:

1. C++: [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2)
2. Python: [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/)

### Prerequisites

Again, it depends on the language. For example: for C++, a compiler is
obviously needed; for Python, it is a good idea to create a virtual environment
and to install all the dependencies on it.

### Installation

If you want to create a Github repository for your project, a nice README file
is something always good to have. If you want to create badges like the ones at
the top of this file, I recommend that you use
[Shields.io](https://shields.io/).
